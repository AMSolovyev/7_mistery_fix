<h1> Quadratic Equations  </h1>
<h2> Find roots with numbers a, b, c. You can use a descriminate. </h2>


<h1> Project Goals </h1>
<h2> You have to check your module with script test.py.</h2>
<h2>  You input numbers for a, b, c at finally you can check:
if descriminate>0, 
elif descriminate = 0, 
else descriminate = 0 </h2>
