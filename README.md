<h1> Quadratic Equations  </h1>
<h3> Find roots with numbers a, b, c. You can use a descriminate. </h3>
<h3> The script tests.py checks work quadratic_equation.py.
You can use in the script tests.py module quadratic_equation.py like this:

from quadratic_equation import get_roots     </h3>

<h1> Project Goals </h1>
<h3> You have to check your module with script tests.py.</h3>
<h3>  The script tests.py checks the quadratic equation task solution on the different conditions.</h3>

 <h1>How to use in linux:</h1>

<h3> python3 tests.py </h3>

<h3>The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - DEVMAN.org</h3>
