<pre> Find roots with numbers a, b, c. You can use a descriminate. 
      The script tests.py checks work quadratic_equation.py.
      You can use in the script tests.py module quadratic_equation.py like this: </pre>

<div>from quadratic_equation import get_roots </div>   

<h1> Project Goals </h1>
