<h1> Quadratic Equations  </h1>

<pre> Find roots with numbers a, b, c. You can use a descriminate. </pre> 
<pre> The script tests.py checks work quadratic_equation.py.
You can use in the script tests.py module quadratic_equation.py like this:
from quadratic_equation import get_roots     </pre>

<h1> Project Goals </h1>

<pre> You have to check your module with script tests.py.</pre>
<pre> The script tests.py checks the quadratic equation task solution on the different conditions.
 </pre>

 <h1> How to use in linux:</h1>

<pre> python3 tests.py </pre>

<h1> Project Goals</h1>

<pre> The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - DEVMAN.org</pre>
